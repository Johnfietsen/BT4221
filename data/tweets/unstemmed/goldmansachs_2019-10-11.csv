but alas itll definitely take govt action to get the ball rolling even a smidgen bc as long as the big banks think oil amp gas is a sure thing theyll keep investing in it
another benefit of that collective action is that as oil and gas become more expensive thanks to divestment green energy investments become less risky and more profitable in the short term
the longterm dividends of green energy are enormous and surefire all it takes is collective commitment from large banks to get over the hurdle of shortterm risk cont
green energy has more risk in the short term sure but the more banks divest from oil and gas and invest in green energy the less risky the investment becomes bc now the risk is spread evenly cont
sarcasm aside it would actually pay dividends longterm theyre banking literally on the assumption that oil amp gas wont tank in the future if they dump those investments tomorrow they free themselves of that risk
